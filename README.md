-Compiler
This is a compiler written for a C++ Class. Driver.cc demonstrates my knowledge of C++ and Object Oriented Programming. 
The headers were removed to avoid providing answers to people who are in a similar class.
##<ins>JavaScript</ins>
-Google Apps Script Compiler
This is a current project where I am translating from the C++ source provided in this portfolio, and translating it to
JavaScript to demonstrate my ability to translate between different languages. This will include headers. It uses a 
Google sheet (added here as a .xlsx file) to read/write data, with the provided .js files representing the attached Apps Scripts.
